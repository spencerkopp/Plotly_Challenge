# Plotly_Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create interactive data visualizations including a bar chart, a gauge chart, and a bubble chart. Users' selection from the drop down menu are used to populate the demographic info section and update the visualizations based on users' information. D3 event listeners are used to dynamically update content. CSS and bootstrap are used to style the page with unique elements. The original data can be found at samples.json.
